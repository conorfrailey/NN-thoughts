## How to shrink a large NN to a smaller "good enough" NN?
We spend all this time essentially learning piece-wise linear functions, right? 
Can we use some sort of projections to shrink?

## How can one NN "teach" another NN?
Is there a notion of language? 
Model1 has learned rules in A. 
Model2 has learned rules in A + B. 
Can Model2 ever express B rules in terms of A that can be conveyed to Model1?
